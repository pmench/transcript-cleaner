But just to start off basic, can you define what people mean when they say net neutrality?<br><br>(No correction needed. Well done!)lot like the law of gravity, it's sort of a principle that certain companies and ISPs have abided by for many years. The idea is that a packet is a packet is a packet and what an ISP does is it moves packets and treats all of those packets the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

And we think that this also applies to the digital realm, especially when the information available about you when somebody searches the digital 28:51 realm is so detailed and so incredibly personal. And so, that really speaks to the core of our mission. Furthermore, even if you feel like you don't have anything to hide, maybe all your doors are unlocked, and maybe you don't wear pants, and maybe you're just living life all out there in the open, not everyone is in a position to do that. The world is full of people who have things to hide, who are not up to no good. If you are, for example, a woman on the internet with opinions, let me tell you, you have things to hide because people will come after you and harass you. The same thing is true of Muslims and people of color. It's true of people with unpopular political opinions. It's true of people with unpopular religious beliefs. And so, even if you feel like you don't have something to hide, it's really important to protect this right for these other people. For one thing, somewhere down the line, you could become one of them. Then you would regret that potential stance that you had in the past once it begins detecting you.the password that you use they won't be able to access your account without that second factor code. Additionally, using encrypted communication tools like Signal or PGP can help protect your messages and data from interception. So, it's important to take these steps to secure your online privacy and stay safe from potential threats.31:39 "Your password" should be "Your password, " since there is a pause in the sentence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And even those that did have established religions eventually moved away from that. But beyond that, there's also a sense in which the claim that the US is a Christian nation is misleading or incomplete because it ignores the diversity of religious beliefs and practices that have always been present in the country. So while Christianity has certainly been an important and influential religion in the US, it has never been the only one, nor the only one that has mattered. And in recent decades, the country has become even more diverse religiously, with growing numbers of people who identify as non-religious or have alternative spiritual beliefs. So I think the claim that the US is a Christian nation is not only inaccurate historically, but also ignores the complex and changing nature of religious life in the country.(at 1:41) It wasn't true, but it's not true in the sort of the grand sense of having an established Christianity, although some specific states have established religions.<br>(at 1:48) Certainly, lots of people have long thought that the U.S. is a Christian nation and have acted accordingly, but really, the U.S. is a very religiously diverse nation and always has been.<br>(at 2:00) So, there's the reality of the religious pluralism of it, but then there's also this sort of strain of ideology that tries to say that the U.S. is a Christian nation, which is almost like a political claim, and is actually really influential. Now, this is not in the book we're talking about, but I've done some research showing that the strongest religious predictor of voting for Donald Trump in the most recent presidential election was Christian nationalism--how people thought about a range of things about whether religion should be in the public sphere or whether explicitly saying the U.S. is a Christian nation. So the Christian nationalism claim is influential and it's important to understand it, but historically it's not true in the sense of establishment. |
