hi Joseph hey Philip how are you good how are you I'm doing well welcome to
0:06
meaning of life dot TV thanks for having me on oh yes let me introduce us I am Philip menchaca
0:12
and you are Joseph baker associate professor in the Department of
0:17
Sociology at East Tennessee State University and you are also a senior
0:23
research associate for the association of religion data archives the author of
0:28
paranormal America and the co-author of the book we're going to discuss today
0:33
which is right here American secularism and as listeners may
0:42
gather we are going to be discussing secularism in America and some of the
0:49
some of its links to politics and what it means to be secular and some of the
0:55
trends in secularism in the United States over the past Oh decade or so and
1:04
I want to start though with getting your thoughts on a claim that is frequently
1:12
made about the United States and I want us you know what do you think about the
1:18
idea that the u.s. is a Christian nation all right yeah oh well there's a couple
1:27
of ways to look at this one is that historically that has not been the case
1:33
at least in the sense of an established religion now some states specific states have established religions so it wasn't
1:41
true but it's not true in the sort of the grand sense of having an established christened them now certainly lots of
1:48
people have long thought that the u.s. is a Christian nation tried to act accordingly but really the u.s. is a
1:55
very religiously diverse nation and always has been and so there's the
2:00
reality of sort of the religious pluralism of it but then there's also this sort of strain of ideology that
2:07
tries to say that the u.s. is a Christian nation is almost like a political claim the
2:12
is actually really influential now this is not in the book we're talking about what I like I've done some research showing that the strongest religious
2:19
predictor of voting for Donald Trump in the most recent presidential election was Christian nationalism so like how
2:24
people thought about a range of things about whether religion should be in the public sphere or whether explicitly
2:30
saying the u.s. is a Christian nation so the Christian nationalism claim is influential and it's important to
2:37
understand it but historically it's not true in the sense of establishment and you know practically in terms of numbers
2:44
the religion the US has always been a very diverse nation and even now a lot
2:50
of times when people talk about the u.s. as a Christian nation they reference sort of this mythical past but
2:56
historians who study you know the religion of the US and colonial times will say it wasn't actually that pious
3:01
and either and it was pretty diverse and there were different types of religions going on and so it's more mythology than
3:09
fact in terms of history but it's an influential myth as well I would say interesting I so I wasn't planning on
3:16
getting into this but since you bring it up Donald Trump a question I'm sure you
3:23
avoid that's an interesting statistic did you happen to how did you gather
3:30
that was a survey data you were looking at yeah it's a national survey of American adults and so we have really
3:37
good measures of religion so at the same time we're assessing Christian nationalism we're also looking at
3:42
religious affiliation which specific religion you affiliated with how much you practice so how much you attend
3:48
religious services how much you pray biblical literalism which is kind of a standard measure in the social religion
3:54
and views of the Bible and incorporating all those things as well as controlling
4:00
for political identity and associated demographics Christian nationalism is
4:05
the most important religious predictor the most important predictors overall of
4:10
voting for Trump or party ID which is not surprising then a measure of what's
4:15
basically xenophobia a fear of immigrants and then Christian nationalism is a close third and
4:23
that papers under review right now so we're probably out in the next year or so but the Christian nationalism thing is a
4:29
very influential idea politically and it's not going away I'd say that so just
4:36
because you still like history itself doesn't support the idea doesn't mean that people don't believe it and act on
4:42
it yeah this actually goes to something that you mentioned I think towards the end of American secularism when I
4:50
believe you talked about the case in Ireland where during the Troubles yeah
4:59
and the link between religion and nationalism can you explain a little bit about that and then we can go into why
5:06
I'm thinking that this connection sure well we used it as a comparison to say
5:12
that so people hold up Western Europe as a more secular region and Ireland and
5:18
Northern Ireland have long been something of an exception to levels of secularity in Europe and people point to
5:24
the political conflict and the salience of religion in the political conflict is part of the reason the joke is that you
5:31
can be an atheist but you have to be a Catholic or a Protestant atheist you know so you still have to pick sides in
5:36
sort of the political conflict we used it to try to talk about how for at least
5:44
the period in the 1950s until really the 90s the external threat to the United
5:51
States was perceived to be communism and godless communism in it and sort of secularity was linked to communism and
5:57
so there was this external enemy that was associated with secularity and during this time secularity among the
6:04
populace is low if you look at opinion surveys and things like that people are very low levels of people say they
6:11
either have no religion or that they're atheist etc as that threat perceived threat began to wane and it switched to
6:18
other external threats Islam things like that the level of people claiming
6:26
secularity the population rose so part of the argument there was that part of what it might have been keeping
6:31
secularity down was this external threat and it's linked to secularity rhetoric and politics and you can look
6:37
at explicitly if you look at like McCarthyism and things like that where there's very serious consequences for
6:43
being secular and then you know as you move toward the end of that era in the 70s 80s the the price or the cost might
6:49
be less but there's still a strong stigma associated with it but as that wanes it opens up more space for people
6:55
to claim secularity so we were making the comparison to Ireland to say that you've always got a look at political
7:01
conflict and it's linked to religious identity to try to get some sense of kind of like how things will will fall
7:07
out yeah so to bring this back to that Trump survey do you think that what might be happening there is there is
7:16
this perception of external threats that's driving that was driving
7:21
Christian nationalism support for Trump yeah certainly I mean Christian
7:26
nationalism has strong links to other types of ideologies so for instance I
7:32
talked about the xenophobia ideology it's strongly related to Christian nationalism now they're not the same
7:37
think of them it's kind of like it's like a Venn diagram there's some overlap but there's some distinction so you can
7:43
be one without the other but many people are both and the Christian nationalism idea if you look at it historically
7:50
going through all the 20th 20th century usually it's claimed as a way to exclude
7:56
people who are seen as racially or ethnically other so like you know the rise of the Klan in the 1920s to the
8:03
1940s that you're sort of latching on to this idea of Christian nationalism and to them that meant kicking out the
8:09
Catholics which is kind of ironic given that it's sort of the original Christian Church right but there it's like this
8:17
idea has a link to sort of kicking out the immigrants and so there's a Christian nationalism and sort of
8:24
ethnocentrism and xenophobia are all sort of interwoven so I think there's
8:29
definitely an element of that to it but at the same time there's a lot of people who would consider themselves evangelical and if you ask them
8:37
questions explicitly about racial and ethnic animus or dislike of certain groups they wouldn't come out as being
8:43
overtly racist but at the same time they would come out as being high on Christian nationalism scale so it almost
8:50
works as a way to activate people's latent racial or ethnic fears without
8:57
explicitly saying hey be a racist and so it's almost like it's not quite a dog
9:03
whistle but it's a little more of like an indirect play and it's very effective
9:08
and some politicians use it better than others and we argue that this is how Trump secured a large portion of the
9:15
religious vote because before the election people were really saying well you know he's this you know
9:21
thrice-married New Yorker you know it doesn't seem to care about personal
9:26
morality will religious people vote for him blah blah blah but when you actually got to the polls they voted for him at
9:32
the same rates they voted for Mitt Romney it was very pious all the Mormon but so
9:37
there didn't seem to be any slack off in the religious vote and we argued that largely what he did is he activated the
9:43
Christian nationalism strain of this is sort of the motivating factor okay well
9:48
that's very interesting we'll look forward to that paper tick slow but it comes out sooner than later yeah - kinda
9:57
I guess back up a little bit what truck there yeah well that's totally fine it's
10:03
what we do what do people mean when they say that they're secular well people different people mean
10:10
different things and so we include as sort of in this large umbrella so this
10:15
idea of non religion as an umbrella category we include in that people who would say explicitly I'm an atheist I
10:22
don't believe in God people who would say explicitly I'm an agnostic or you know I don't know if there's a God and I
10:28
don't know if you can find out kind of like the sort of the identity version and the belief version and then we also
10:34
include people who say if we say what's your religion and that's that no no religion but then if you ask a theism
10:40
question they say yes they say some form of theism so we call those people non-affiliated believers so we include
10:47
all of them in this sort of the secular category because the last group is explicitly saying I have no religion and
10:55
that's important but it's also important to realize that that category sort of straddles the line between religion and
11:00
secularity you're kind of half-and-half out right so you're organized religion you're out
11:07
but on the supernaturalism you're still accepting parts of what will be
11:12
considered traditional religious views see if you imagine that as a continuum you could kind of have your firm atheist
11:19
over here is sort of like fully secular or something to that let that effect and then you could have non-affiliated
11:25
belief is kind of the in-between category before you move back over to religion so what we're arguing is that
11:31
we should study all three of those groups fairly intently and in depth and
11:38
that they all want their own study some people try to slice out different parts
11:43
inside of those so they'll say let's look at the spiritual but not religious and those people tend to be concentrated
11:48
in the non-affiliated believer group and so and I'm all for all of that stuff but
11:54
we basically include people if they said I have no religion on an affiliation question or if they said either I'm an
12:01
atheist or an agnostic and it deserves know that you can be affiliated non-theist so that's quite possible
12:09
right I could be a Jewish atheist or so right and that would be what some people sometimes call culturally religious or
12:18
right and I think I do think it actually correct me if I'm wrong but I think they tends to be very high levels of that in
12:25
in Judaism right correct so there are higher levels of that in Judaism there's
12:31
some affinity with the ethnic marker sort of maintaining sort of family connections but you might say well sure
12:38
you know my family's Jewish and I'm Jewish but I don't believe in God and that makes total sense in some ways you
12:44
know that part of the religious beliefs don't make sense to you but the cultural part does or you could be someone who
12:50
still finds meaning in the ritual even though you don't necessarily believe in supernaturalism or if we want to move it
12:58
outside of the example of Judaism the Unitarians explicitly say you can be an
13:04
atheist and agnostic and come here and so in those cases people may be non-theist but religiously affiliated
13:10
and maybe actually active you know at going to their congregation so we allow for that sort of diversity
13:18
to happen we don't push those people out like if you say I'm an agnostic but I
13:23
still affiliated and we don't say oh okay you're religious we still included as part of our study but those things
13:30
actually deserve attention on their own a specified study of affiliated non-theist is worth doing right so I
13:38
don't think it will come as any surprise to people listening that the rate of
13:44
secularism seems to have been increasing in the United States over the past I'm not exactly sure the time frame but
13:50
certainly over the past 10 years since 1990 is when the uptick goes and
13:55
what do you see as driving that trend
14:00
short answer politics but also different
14:06
views of organized religion across generations so and those two things are
14:12
related so the let me back up and say that
14:18
so the to give the description of the the increase the General Social Survey
14:24
started in 1973 they've asked the same question about religion since they
14:29
started which is what is your religious preference and then they give you Protestant Catholic Jewish other and you
14:35
can fill in what other you know and none so they asked question the same way when
14:41
they started in the 70s they would get six to seven percent of Americans who said none that was pretty stable until
14:47
1990 it was still 7% so in a lot of ways if you look take a snapshot of the u.s.
14:53
from early 70s to right at 1990 it looks like basic stability but then
15:00
in 91 the number of percentage saying no religion started to go up and it
15:06
continues to go up pretty steadily from 91 until the present day till the point
15:11
where now latest surveys will say 23 24 percent of Americans say they have no
15:17
religion now I'm a sociologist of religion and that is a radical
15:23
transformation of a religious marketplace if you want to call it that in a short amount of time to have the
15:30
percentage of people say they have no religion triple and 20 years is fairly astounding so then okay what's happening
15:38
and we try to pull that apart and one of the main things is that most of those people are not atheist or agnostic most
15:44
of them fall into that other category that non-affiliated believers are saying none but they're maintaining some type
15:50
of theism so that's one thing is that it's not all moving into what we
15:56
typically think of as your standard sort of secular individual they're kind of in
16:01
between mostly there's no organized religion more than chroming theist correct so that's the distinction
16:08
actually is that it's a reaction against organized religion but not necessarily a
16:13
decline in supernaturalism so atheism agnosticism combined have increased a
16:18
little bit so there is a little bit of uptick there and some people say that that'll go up in the future and that's
16:23
possible but you know we'll wait and see but for the most part it seems to be mainly a reaction against organized
16:29
religion and that's so ok so what's going on there well if you look at what
16:35
has happened in the 1980s the sort of the GOP in some sense captured the root
16:42
you know kind of the Protestant right the rise of the religious right so you can look at Falwell the moral majority
16:47
and you had this movement of conservative Protestantism which used to be fairly evenly distributed between
16:53
Republican and Democrat and part of this is a transition of the solid Democratic South to the solid Republican south so a
17:01
lot of those southern evangelicals are moving from you know Democrat to Republican but as that period of
17:08
consolidation occurred from 1979 to the early 90s as that occurred then there'd
17:15
be afterwards there was sort of a reaction by moderates and liberals so people who might have been nominally
17:21
religious before and said yeah you know I'm culturally Catholic or something now might look at sort of what religion is
17:29
and its political meaning has changed and so on TV and hearing people talk about it you hear like to be religious
17:34
as to be you know against gay marriage anti-abortion and to be all these things
17:41
and you and people would look at that and think well that's not me if that's what it means to be religious then like I'm not yeah right so in in some sense
17:48
it's people who probably weren't deeply embedded to begin with and so there's kind of a move away from it as it's like
17:55
that's not that doesn't represent me and then you also have the children of people from that era growing up who have
18:03
radically different views of specifically sexuality and also things
18:08
like premarital sex same-sex relations and also things like pot use and so
18:15
younger generations are liberal on that stuff and it does not jive with the religious right and so even kids who are
18:21
raised inside of the religious right once they come of age have now are more likely to drop out and so what's driving
18:29
the uptick is a rise in what we call the apostasy rate which might be we don't mean it pejoratively how you know it
18:36
doesn't sound great I guess is what it is one of my colleagues says one person's apostate is another person's convert but
18:44
we mean it in the sense of you were raised inside of a religious tradition and then you've dropped out and so that
18:51
has been on the increase and that is what's driving that up taken primarily the people who are dropping out or
18:57
political moderates and liberals and especially people of younger generations so if you look at people under 35 the
19:03
percent saying they have no religion is up around a third or higher and so that's kinda so we sort of make the
19:11
answer that it's politics and then it's also generational sort of shifts in attitudes
19:17
about morality and that those those two things are obviously connected connected
19:22
and that that is the main driver that's kind of like led to this transition what
19:29
are some of the demographic traits associated with strong religious belief or a strong affiliation well there's a
19:38
there's a few different ones so being so women are more likely to be religious of
19:44
various varieties basically however you measure whether it's belief
19:49
practice in the u.s. ethnic minorities are more likely to be religious
19:55
especially African Americans but also Hispanic Americans so there's some
20:00
demographic patterns there there's an interesting dynamic with education where
20:06
higher education makes you more likely to be involved with a religious organization it also tends to drive down
20:12
supernaturalism so there's a countervailing effect there where like
20:18
for instance a college degree makes you more likely to be a non theist and it simultaneously makes you more likely to
20:24
attend religious services so it's doing both of those things at the same time that's a price I well I didn't think of
20:33
an explanation for that why do you have here and there's the explanation as best I could give one is that higher
20:39
education makes you more likely to be civically engaged in all types of civic organizations including religious
20:45
organizations so you're more likely to vote you're more likely to be a member of the PTA you're also more likely to be
20:51
a member of a religious organization now you may quietly be an agnostic while
20:57
being a member of that religious organization but so education has these
21:03
kind of countervailing effects on that there is a definitive age pattern to
21:08
religiosity older people are more religious so and there's a life cycle patterns there where people are more
21:14
likely to drop out in 20s and 30s come back in midlife and then especially late
21:20
life they're much higher rates of religiosity there so those are kind of
21:25
the standard ones and now in the u.s. this is not a demographic factor but political identity conservatives are
21:32
much more religious and liberals are much less likely to be pious and sort of the traditional sense and so those are
21:38
those are some basic ones yeah and you idiot rebuke that that liberal conservative really just split to the
21:45
way that the conservative party has used religion and politics what's the
21:51
so-called God strategy right correct yeah and if you if you read that book that is a fabulous book that God
21:58
strategy I haven't but great book it's about political rhetoric and sort of the use of taught
22:05
like political rhetoric about religion and it's about the GOP and sort of using that language but so we can actually
22:12
test this if I I can take surveys from the 50s and 60s and if I have a measure
22:17
of political identity it's basically uncorrelated with service attendance how often you go to religious
22:24
services but now it's strongly correlated with religious service attendance and with the GSS you can
22:30
actually watch this correlation go up over time so it's not an inevitable
22:36
consequence it is instead an outcome of a political strategy and political
22:43
realignment so it's not as if inevitably conservatives are more religious it's
22:48
it's an outcome of sort of the political machinations and strategies now a few of
22:56
the most high-profile secularists in you
23:02
know recent years it's the the New Atheists these are strongly militantly
23:08
atheists as they're sometimes described people like Chris Hitchens or Lawrence
23:17
Krauss I think is although I think he objects to the term himself as sometimes lumped in with them Dawkins on Dennis
23:23
Bennett yeah do you think that well what
23:28
do you think their effect on secularism if any has been well there's a couple
23:35
things there I mean certainly a lot of individuals do cite though reading those
23:40
texts as important in their own sort of
23:46
conversion to non-theism if you want to call it that or their transition to non-theism so and they sold millions
23:53
books for sure and it's fair to say i think that as you're saying they're probably the most prominent public faces
24:01
of secularism and so in some ways they've kind of the secularism more in
24:08
the public sphere so there's more visibility for it so those are
24:13
at least quasi positive things but to give a negative thing I think there is
24:19
also now sort of this perception and it's always been there in some ways the
24:25
Dawkins style only reinforces it for people who already believe this but to assume that Oh a theists are the angry
24:32
atheist they hate all religious people you know and they don't there's they're
24:37
as prejudiced as anybody and so I think while at the same time it's been
24:44
liberating for some people who have read those and found them to be insightful that at the same time it has not done
24:52
any favours with trying to quell anti atheist prejudice which is a very real thing right the mean this is if you look
24:59
at again in the US surveys groups who people say they dislike atheists are at
25:04
the top it used to be that they were at the top alone but now they're at the top relatively equally with as long so but
25:13
anthe atheist prejudice is a real thing I don't think people like Dawkins do any I don't think they lessen that to any
25:19
degree because if I'm a religious person and I look at that and listen to that rhetoric I just kind of say oh that's
25:26
what I thought it was you know it's just they're just anti religious and they think we're all stupid and so in one way
25:34
you can see it as being beneficial for people and liberating for people who read it and feel like okay look I'm not
25:40
alone there's somebody else who sees the world in this naturalistic way and I can
25:46
find my way in this and so you can see the benefit there and but on the public
25:51
level I don't think the way they go about it is the best strategy for
25:56
seculars to have a public voice now that
26:01
people differ in this because this sort of the quote-unquote militant part of the movement would say no no we have to
26:08
oppose superstition in all its forms and things like that and I tend to come at it from a little bit more of a coalition
26:16
reformed type thing where it's like look if there are liberal religious groups or
26:21
groups who are in line with us on some particular issue then we should work right I mean like there should be a
26:27
coalition I mean just because someone believes in the supernatural is no reason for me not to partner with them
26:33
if we both believe in economic and racial justice and so you know but part
26:41
of that's just a matter of strategy and things like that so I'm of two minds about it one is that having done
26:46
interviews with people you see lots of instances where people say it's been very positive for them so you can see that part of it but then on the public
26:53
discourse part I don't think it's removing anybody stereotypes about what
26:59
an atheist is yeah now the sort of coalition approach to secularism in
27:07
society that you mentioned that's interesting that's something that I think Unitarian Universalists have very
27:15
much been pushing saying you know even having on their website things like atheists welcome yeah how's that working
27:22
out for them actually quite well in this sense
27:27
okay so liberal Protestant groups so Episcopalians United Church of Christ
27:33
the PC USA which are like the liberal Presbyterians those groups are all
27:40
fairly liberal on a lot of social economic justice issues and a lot of times on gender and sexuality issues too
27:47
at the same time the numbers of all those groups have been rapidly declining for the last 30 or 40 years they've been
27:55
hollowed out and I could you know I work at the data archive I can show you the numbers on these denominations they're losing members the you you are actually
28:03
growing so in some sense they are staving off the decline that is hurting
28:10
other liberal religious groups I think through two things by having a more
28:15
inclusive approach that says Buddhists fine you can have a home here atheist
28:22
we're cool with that you know I mean we're not going to hate on you if that's how you feel and so they've sort of been a little
28:28
more welcoming it's a larger tent then you might get in other liberal religions
28:34
still rely on supernaturalism and sort of traditional ism or something and the other thing
28:40
that they've done positively is they are have really high levels of civic engagement so people who attend uu
28:47
congregations tend to be involved in the community they seem to volunteer for things they vote you know they serve at
28:54
soup kitchens and so the you use have been successful with having kind of this coalition approach and also pushing
29:01
civic engagement to say that like liberal religion if you want to call it that or liberal philosophy or whatever
29:07
does not mean that you just get to sit at home and feel you know good about yourself we want we expect you to go do
29:14
something and so if you compare them to other groups who have similar political
29:20
views they've done better they fared better than the groups who are staying
29:26
within traditional Protestantism while trying to combine with some form of liberalism now I mean that's there's
29:31
still a fairly small group overall in terms of like total population or
29:37
something but I mean it's I and so I gave a you know quote-unquote sermon for a uu congregation around here and I
29:43
showed them some numbers on this to say look these other groups of the clock declining in here doing fairly well and
29:49
of course they were happy to see that but I think a lot of it has to do with the combination of the coalition
29:55
approach but also asking something of people right to say that like you know
30:01
civic engagement is is is the way to go it's what we believe in in getting a commitment once people feel committed to
30:07
a cause through actual action it's easier to bring them together as a
30:13
community yeah and so as a sociologist of religion the liberal groups the liberal
30:18
Protestant groups all have what we call in economics you'd call the free rider problem which is like if I want to show
30:24
up on Easter and Christmas and I will and I know the Pisgah poles would still be here and they'll have the ritual and
30:30
everything but they're not gonna come knocking on my door and be like where have you been you know so they tend to
30:36
have this thing where they don't they don't require a lot of people to
30:42
participate and it's not that you use an explicitly say you have to volunteer
30:47
seven times or something but there is a culture of act and a culture of engagement that says
30:53
look if you're gonna be in this group this is what we're all gonna be doing you know and so I feel like they've been
31:00
in numbers show this they've been more successful at trying to stay engaged and
31:06
have in a liberal group their members engaged whereas other liberal groups tend to be sort of plagued with weak
31:12
members have you looked at how many of these explicitly secular or atheist kinds of groups have been faring things
31:19
like sunday assembly though they have varying degrees of atheism or Oasis I
31:27
think is another one some of these secular so-called secular churches
31:33
yeah well secular churches are a specific so I look at some we looked at some nonprofit groups so secular Student
31:40
Association and things like that now those groups are all growing they're growing quite rapidly
31:46
now the Sunday assembly is a specific it's again as you said these church or
31:51
whatever you want to call it and that I know less about but I'm they're a friend
31:57
of mine at the University of Minnesota as a grad student there and she's doing her dissertation it's an ethnography of the Sunday assembly
32:02
Jackie frost at Minnesota so I assume hopefully that'll be a book in the next few years and I've seen her work on that
32:09
so it's really interesting in terms of how people are trying to form community and what's kind of a quasi you know
32:16
congregational model but also sort of removing some of the traditional sort of
32:23
structures of church and things like that so most of those groups are like
32:31
secular Student Association is thriving it's fair to say that Sunday is simply I don't know their numbers so in terms of
32:37
like are they growing I'm not really sure they seem to be sustaining fairly well and perhaps they're growing I just
32:42
don't know right but most secular organizations are doing well and I would sit better than they
32:50
were around 10 or 15 years ago better now than they were then and so we profile like American Humanist
32:56
Association and that's true for them and so on the whole they're doing well but again the biggest share these people
33:03
dropping out aren't explicitly say I'm an atheist so the biggest share these people of the population are not
33:08
affiliating with these groups so they are growing but at the same time there's
33:13
a large pool of people who are outside of organizations now so it seems like
33:19
there may be an increasing acceptance of non-believers in the u.s. do you think that is true in the future like is that
33:25
the way the trends are moving barely yes
33:31
so again GSS has asked questions like would you be ok if an atheist taught
33:37
college would you be at okay if an atheist had their book in the library
33:42
and those things have been trending towards less prejudice but not in a
33:48
dramatic way so in a mild way but I
33:53
would say this the more that people are open about being non-religious which is
33:59
certainly more prevalent now than it used to be we would expect some of those prejudices to lessen just by virtue of
34:06
contact theory so just like people coming out as gay lesbian bisexual
34:12
transgender has served in some ways to lessen that stigma if you look at public
34:18
opinion polls because people now say instead of thinking oh I hate gay people
34:24
they think oh well I know this person and they're actually a really good person and you know they're good to
34:29
their partner and blah blah blah it sort of removes the ability to other somebody
34:35
without thinking about it so to the extent that more people are open about it and by virtue of that more people
34:43
know someone who's non-religious and you know hopefully for the most part they
34:49
think of those people saying well there's you know there's still good upstanding citizens and things like that did that should lessen
34:56
the prejudice and there has been evidence of that in other countries where there's higher levels of
35:01
secularity so um it's trending that way but my caveat is that it's not trending
35:08
in a really fast way at least yet but if more people are open about being outside
35:13
of religion I think you'll see some of that before we wrap up here have you
35:20
looked or you know research that's looked at countries where there's been
35:25
forced a theism for secularism and thinking like China for instance what's
35:32
sort of the situation there do people are they crypto religious or does the
35:39
secularism actually take you find higher levels of self process professed secularism you do find higher levels of
35:47
self professed secularism but religion persists so there is good research on
35:52
China thinking yang is the leading scholar on that he talks about you know
35:58
like I think he calls them red gray and some other religious markets so there's kind of like some religions that you can
36:04
do publicly others are underground but they've not been successful at driving
36:09
out religion totally the stuff I'm more familiar with one of my mentors did has
36:15
done a lot of research on Russia and he's got a great book called a plot to kill God about sort of how the Russian
36:23
Revolution essentially tried to extinguish religion and you know and
36:29
theism with it and how those efforts largely in the long run were not
36:35
successful despite you know they continued and in some instances you know
36:44
sort of horrific and tyrannical effort to do so and once those restrictions
36:49
were lifted religion came back almost like you you know had covered this garden and suddenly showed at the
36:55
sunlight and then it's like all the stuff just flowers now interestingly Putin now is trying to co-opt the
37:03
Orthodox Church and has done so reasonably successfully which is
37:09
Paul my mentor Argos is frankly what they should have done to begin with don't kill it take it over
37:15
you know if we're thinking strategically but yeah so efforts at for
37:20
secularization you do end up if you're looking an opinion survey so if you look at percentage of people who believe in God
37:26
it'll be lower in Russia China former communist countries it will be lower but
37:32
there's also still a considerable amount of traditional religion you know New Age
37:39
forms of religion it's like I mean it's to me it's one of those things that you
37:45
you can't kill it I mean you can you can push it underground but it'll it'll find
37:51
a way to persist and people if they want to believe in something or want to do something they will sustain it and so
37:58
you know for secularization frankly you're better off if you want a secular country you're better off the boy to do it is to
38:05
have good social safety net and have high levels of what we would call existential security which means you
38:13
have access to education health social services the basic needs and so the
38:20
places that are higher and those are where you find the highest levels of secularity so if you want to scan on
38:26
avian countries you know that's where you find the highest level of non-theism so if you know if you're imagining that
38:33
you're some you know ruler and your goal is secularity then you should like social security and public education you
38:40
know I mean forget trying to kill the church right there's I mean there is the idea that when you're in a country when
38:48
you're living a life where your basic needs are not met or it's always a struggle and you know desperate poverty
38:56
around you you need religion you need faith that there's good supernatural
39:02
power looking out for you there's comfort and they'll kind of belief so that makes sense that in countries that
39:07
provide stable you know living situation you are gonna have higher rates of
39:13
specularity yeah and analyses at the spacial level bear this out so like for
39:19
instance just as a quanta the highest correlation I get at the country level is if I go infant mortality belief in God so the
39:28
more like life is in threat the higher you expect theism to be and this holds
39:33
across countries globally and it holds inside of regions too so if I split the u.s. up
39:39
by county or by state and I look at levels of poverty and you know sort of
39:48
death and despair it correlates with theism and religiosity so that basic
39:55
Association holds you know pretty well across different regions now it's not a perfect thing it's not as if you if you
40:02
have perfect existential security quote-unquote you're because you can't have it you will die right so it's like
40:10
no matter what you are not gonna have perfect existential security so on some
40:15
level you know there's always a need for it there or there's always that level of it and it's also not as if people in
40:21
secure countries there are secure places they're all secular some of them are still religious and so there's some
40:27
variation but if you think of it as a verges there's a huge difference between places where I might die today and
40:35
that's every day versus places where you know I'm pretty secure I know that if
40:40
something happens to me I've got access to health care and I know that I'm well taken care of and so there are vast
40:46
differences in population rates of religiosity in those places yeah so last
40:52
question what are you currently working on what's next for you I we are like 80%
40:58
done with a book that I am lovingly calling sex drugs and Bigfoot allow me
41:08
to sell you if that didn't sell you on it allow me to sell you on it it's basically we're outlining a relatively
41:16
parsimonious theory of deviance management by which we mean if you do
41:22
something that is stigmatized by those around you how do you cope with it and you've got a couple that there's a few
41:28
different options if it's high double I can hide all right so you can apply this
41:33
to the example secularism if I'm an atheist nobody has to know unless I tell them so I can pass you
41:40
know what I mean like I just won't talk about it and it will be a problem for me so you could hide that's a that's a
41:45
strategy or coping strategy another coping strategy is to subset to create a
41:52
subculture I'm gonna go join the atheist group and I'm only gonna be around people who are like me that way I don't
41:58
have to deal with religious people so people who stigmatize me they reject me so I reject them and so I build my
42:06
social networks around the subculture a third option though is normalizing where
42:12
I say no no like I'm an open atheist and I'm gonna tell people about it and if
42:17
they want to stigmatize me then I'm gonna try to explain to them why they should not and so that's more of a
42:24
direct engagement so now what we do is we take that we kind of come up with
42:30
this strategy or this theory about who will use what strategy under what circumstance and then we try to apply it
42:38
to three different subcultures one is paranormal ism and it's got a heavy
42:44
emphasis on the Sasquatch on this one because we have lots of fieldwork with some different types of Bigfoot groups
42:50
some who say oh it's an undiscovered animal where scientists just like you and some who say no it's a psychic
42:56
sasquatch and I've had communication with the spirit brothers and they have you know brought me this form of enlightenment and those are kind of like
43:03
the normalising strategy and the outsider strategy respectively we have survey data we have fieldwork on
43:10
that then we look at sexual and gender minorities so anybody who says I'm LGBTQ
43:17
LGBTQ and we look at specifically outsider strategies of queer movements
43:23
they're where they're trying to say we don't you know why do we want to be part of gay marriage marriage is a
43:28
patriarchal institution you've got to fight the power versus kind of an assimilation strategy that says we're
43:34
just like you we're family just like you and so it's kind of the normalizing pattern and the
43:41
theory we come up with holds pretty well about who will pick what strategy who will have what and then the last one we look at is
43:49
views of alcohol use and specifically the repeal of prohibition in the United States as an analogue to contemporary
43:57
moves to normalize marijuana use so basically it's like we have this theory
44:04
we lay out the theory and a few chapters and then it's like application chapters where does it apply and this
44:10
circumstance how does it apply in this circumstance it's a bit of a weird one because it's substantively kind of all
44:16
over the map but the theory is pretty concise and so it's basically a theory
44:24
book that's trying to do some application to show that you know we're not just making this up and that it holds under these different
44:30
circumstances right if there's actually a advantage to having such different circumstances because it means the
44:36
theory applies more widely correct and it's more fun for us and since that I
44:42
don't have to keep doing the same thing over and over for 10 years which is frankly what I did for the secularism
44:48
book guys like all secularism all the time now it's like okay you know I can I
44:53
can do the paranormal ISM thing for a bit and then we just shift gears and I can you know do some historical work on the repeal of prohibition it keeps me
45:00
from you keeps me from getting bored okay well that's always a good goal well
45:07
listen thanks so much for for anyone who is scrambling to go pick up a copy of
45:14
American secularism after this this is the book here there's a lot of data in it it's it's very interesting I would
45:21
recommend it to anyone and thanks so much for joining us absolutely thanks
45:28
for having me yeah all right take care you too
