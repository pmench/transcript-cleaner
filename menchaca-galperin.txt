hi Eva hey there I welcome vlogging heads thank you so much for having me
0:06
yes thank you very much for being here let me introduce us I am Philip menchaca
0:11
editor at blogging heads TV and you are Eva galperin director of cyber security
0:19
for the Electronic Frontier Foundation that's right and we are going to talk
0:24
today about privacy and security generally and specifically talk a little
0:31
bit about net neutrality and maybe some state-sponsored malware issues but first
0:40
can you just tell me what the e FF does sure FF stands for Electronic Frontier
0:47
Foundation we are a digital civil liberties organization that has been around since 1990 and our job is to make
0:55
sure that when you go online your rights come with so what are some of the current projects that BFF is engaged in
1:03
well the e FF is currently a vast undertaking so there are a lot of us working on different things but one of
1:10
the most interest is about their approach is that we have this sort of unique combination of of tools and
1:17
skills that we can bring to the table sort of like the Justice League so sometimes the problems that face the
1:23
internet that require require a lawyer and then we we file lawsuits we do
1:31
what's called impact litigation so we file a lawsuit with the intention of getting a ruling that that will impact
1:37
people further down the line this is a lot of the kind of thing that the ACLU does for civil liberties both online and
1:44
offline we also have activists for when you need to get people out onto the streets when you need people to sign
1:50
petitions when you need people to write letters or call their their senators or congressmen and we also have a bunch of
1:59
Engineers and what our engineers do is sometimes they build they build tools
2:04
like the Chrome extensions that we run like HTTPS Everywhere and privacy badger
2:12
we're all so part of the group that works on cert
2:17
bot she's also known as let's encrypt making it really easy for people to get free SSL certificates for their websites
2:25
and we also do research into the kinds of problems that people and especially
2:31
vulnerable populations have so we have a we have a website called surveillance
2:37
self defense which is our privacy and security guide and we go around doing
2:44
trainings we also do reports on sort of
2:51
dangers to privacy and security online to vulnerable populations including state-sponsored malware which is a
2:57
fairly large part of my work and we do sort of policy work around this sort of thing as well so sometimes you have to
3:03
go to the hill where you have to go to like the European Court of Human Rights and talk to them about why the Internet
3:09
is important and why the kind of rights that you have offline should also be the kind of rights that you have online that
3:15
great so you have a whole bunch of tools at your disposal at the AFF involved in
3:20
a lot of different things actually use some of the extensions such as privacy
3:26
badgering and HTTPS Everywhere which you
3:31
know crypts your access to certain to do websites when you browse online so I
3:37
recommend people go and check out some of these some of this information and
3:42
resources that e FF has so that's what the FF does and to come kick off our
3:50
conversation here I want to talk with you about an issue that's been in the news recently again it's sort of a
3:58
slow-burning actually I think years long issue now at this point and that is net
4:04
neutrality and this is just to kind of set what the controversy is right now
4:11
the FCC is looking at repealing some
4:16
Obamacare of not Obamacare some rules while it's also Obamacare Obamacare
4:24
looking at repealing some rules that were put in place under Obama that
4:30
protected net neutrality but just to start off basic can you define what
4:35
people mean when they say net neutrality all right so now neutrality is is not a
4:42
lot like the law of gravity it's sort of a a principle that that certain that
4:48
companies and I that ISPs have abided by
4:53
for many years and the idea is that a packet is a packet is a packet and what
5:01
the what an ISP does is it moves packets and it treats all of those packets the
5:07
same and if you are going to one website you should not be able to get better
5:12
bandwidth than if you are going to some other website and the reason why net
5:18
neutrality is is so important is because if you have this sort of pay-for-play
5:24
system where people can pay for better so for better treatment by ISPs or
5:30
preferential treatment by ISPs for their bandwidth then the companies with a lot
5:36
of money and with pre-existing relationships with the ISPs or that are owned by the ISPs are at an unfair
5:44
advantage and new companies that have new ideas and new services that are
5:50
up-and-coming or our startups are at a disadvantage so this would have a tremendously chilling effect on on
5:59
startups and anybody who doesn't necessarily have a lot of money from the very beginning so if so these rules were
6:08
put in place under Obama to kind of keep an even playing field is that correct
6:13
mm-hmm yes so particular companies couldn't pay
6:19
say Verizon to boost their speed or or
6:24
not throttle the speed of their website
6:30
so I guess so the the worry here is that
6:37
for instance a a a company like Verizon
6:42
or Comcast who is an Internet service provider and provides Internet to people
6:47
[Music] could selectively choose which websites
6:54
run well on your browser was that accurate and yes absolutely
7:00
yeah and for a very long time it for a very long time EFS position on net neutrality could
7:07
best be described by teams of like Jesuit priests it was so complicated and
7:13
part of the reason for this is because EF f has a lifetime a lifelong aversion
7:20
to to regulation we have been touched in a bad place by FCC regulation before and
7:28
we don't necessarily want the FCC's sticking their their noses and in our
7:33
business because historically this has not been good for leveling the playing field or for for increasing the
7:42
competitiveness of startups or anything like that the only reason why EF F
7:47
really turned around on this issue and said fine this is actually a situation where the FCC needs to get involved is
7:55
because the ISPs themselves stated that it was their intention to do this and we think that this is tremendously bad for
8:02
a competition this is tremendously bad for innovation and it's very bad for
8:07
users and it's our job to stand up for the users yeah so what can people do about helping preserve net neutrality
8:17
well there are a couple of things that you can do but probably the most important is you can write to the FCC
8:23
the FCC is currently seeking comment on what people think about they're rolling
8:29
back their regulations and you can find a on the e FF website there is a button
8:36
on our home page you can press on that will allow you to contact the FCC and
8:43
them know what you think along with some suggested language that you absolutely don't have to stick to we have also
8:49
taken part in the in a joint letter that was just sent to the FCC written by a
8:57
hundred and ninety network engineers talking about why from a from a network
9:03
standpoint from a purely technical standpoint net neutrality is really important and gutting it is not a good
9:09
idea okay great and there was a big push I think was it last week to try to put
9:17
the word out about the FCC accepting comments do you have absolutely you have to know what the outcome of that was I
9:24
mean in terms of participation I do know that the participation is very high but
9:30
I don't have any exact numbers there there is a long history especially from
9:35
the last time that the net neutrality debate came out of the comments crashing
9:41
the FCC website largely because while EF
9:48
F is able to move a lot of people to action probably the biggest contributor
9:54
to this sort of Pro net neutrality speech weirdly has been John Oliver over
10:00
on HBO and usually when he has an episode about net neutrality on his show people respond in the kind of numbers
10:07
that ESF can only dream of yes I believe he had a he set up a web site go FCC
10:16
yourself calm I believe yes that that
10:22
would redirect you to the comments section on that on the FCC there's also
10:30
been a really interesting trend of a box leaving anti net neutrality comments and
10:38
so it's really important to get real people coming to the site and giving their real views in order to balance out
10:45
this sort of astroturf thing that anti net neutrality campaigners have
10:50
unleashed on the FCC a website that's very interesting so people have created you know automated spamming bots I guess
10:58
to leave mmm the comments and uh in support or against net neutrality yeah
11:05
it's an incredibly worrisome trend yeah I hadn't heard that before that's the
11:11
that's unfortunate so the next thing to kind of switch
11:18
gears I know that you're one of your areas of expertise is state-sponsored
11:24
malware yes and so I'd like to talk to you about about that a little bit in in
11:32
the context of kind of a recent story that as it broken about it seems like
11:41
the Mexican government's use of a particular kind of malware called Pegasus it's a spyware and for people
11:52
who haven't heard of this would you be able to give a recap of just very broad
11:58
overview of kind of what what's happened here all right well let's just start with what's
12:05
state-sponsored spyware is right so I'm imagine that most of the people in your audience are familiar with
12:11
spyware but you can it can covertly load a program onto somebody's device which
12:17
could be if you know their computer or their tablet or their phone that gives you full control over that device this
12:23
allows you to see their and log their keystrokes take screenshots make use of
12:29
their microphone make use of your of the camera if you have full control over
12:34
somebody's phone that's tremendously powerful because you also get their their GPS location at all times it's
12:40
essentially like putting a tracking device in somebody's pocket you can also spy on all of their phone calls it's
12:46
tremendously invasive now spyware is
12:52
pretty ubiquitous lis available I it is possible to buy spyware for you know 40
12:58
or 50 euro online that that has much of the same functionality is the stuff the
13:05
government's buy but when governments decide that they want to purchase and deploy spyware generally
13:13
they don't show up and deploy a 50 euro
13:20
copy of je rat what they do is they either build the software themselves and
13:30
this is particularly common in in the five eyes countries I don't know if your
13:35
audience is familiar with who would qualify as five eyes but that would be America Canada the UK New Zealand and
13:45
Australia who all have a very close sort of surveillance community relationship
13:52
because everybody speaks English you also see this in Russia in China
13:57
increasingly you see it in places like North Korea and Vietnam so these guys
14:03
roll their own they they have armies of trained professionals who build the spyware specifically so that it is very
14:10
difficult for antivirus companies to find it but companies are sorry
14:17
countries that don't have this kind of money to pay tons of engineers to build
14:25
them the custom software all the time sometimes go to third-party vendors and
14:30
these vendors include companies like finfisher which is located I believe in
14:37
the UK and Germany Italian companies like a hacking team and also this the
14:47
this company dark matter in the UAE and a company called NSO group in in Israel
14:56
so NSO group sold their their software
15:02
to a number of different nation-states and they insist that that they only sell
15:07
to nation-states and they tell the they tell the countries we're going to sell you this incredibly powerful and an
15:15
intrusive software on the condition that you only it against bad guys and terrorists they
15:25
have no way of knowing that this is going to happen but that's that's what they say they do
15:32
so they went ahead they sold the software to to Mexico and it turns out
15:37
that the various members of the Mexican government used it to spy on activists
15:47
and scientists who were working on we're working to support a soda tax definitely
15:56
not not terrorism not terrorism I and most most recently they discovered that
16:04
among other things they were also spying on like the the children and the lawyers and all kinds of other people who are
16:10
related to this particular situation and furthermore they discovered that that
16:17
someone in the Mexican government was also using this to spy on a panel that
16:22
was that was convened to to look into the disappearance of 40 students in
16:30
Mexico a couple years ago the disappearance of the students was a very big deal it was a very large
16:36
political issue people went out onto the streets and they protested and masked for months on end demanding that the
16:44
government figure out what happened to these students and it became this sort of symbol for how little control the
16:52
federal government has over you know sort of day to day life in Mexico and
16:58
how little control they have over over the cartels so this independent panel
17:05
was brought in to investigate and it turns out the Mexican government was spying on them using NSA groups
17:12
Pegasus software so again not terrorists what's
17:18
particularly interesting about this was again the NSO group said but we but we insist you only sell oh we only sell to
17:25
governments who tell us that they're going to use this to spy on just by on terrorists how can we possibly know that
17:30
they might misuse this it's like well maybe you might want to have wanted to read citizen labs report
17:36
from six months ago or citizen labs report from eight months ago or if you don't read citizen lab reports perhaps
17:42
the New York Times it might it's come up one search twice but you keep selling to
17:48
these guys and this is also true of some of the other really shady companies that
17:56
have have engaged at this kind of sale right so it's all very bad so this is
18:01
this is very very troubling very powerful software that repressive regimes or just corrupt regimes can use
18:09
to gather information on journalists and
18:15
in citizens and activists having a really you know repressive effect on
18:21
citizens so are there are there any kinds of export controls that countries
18:27
have on this kind of technology well a couple of years ago I would say like
18:33
back in 2013 when we started looking into this stuff and writing reports many
18:39
of the European countries stepped up and said really what we need to do is we
18:47
need to stop these Western countries from selling this software to
18:53
authoritarian States and the way that we're going to do this is through export controls and specifically through a
18:58
thing that's known as the vast in our arrangement which is it's not a treaty it's not legally binding but I think
19:07
like 49 countries they're signatories to it and this is the arrangement by which people by which countries agree to limit
19:15
the sale of weapons so actual physical
19:21
weapons things like land mines and guns and tanks and the things that could be
19:28
used to make landmines and guns and tanks and then they expanded the
19:33
language in the Boston our arrangement to include a sort of surveillance software
19:38
unfortunately the language was expanded in such a way that it could be used to
19:47
sort of chill the kind of exactly the kind of research that unveiled these
19:52
kinds of abuses in the first place which i think is extremely alarming they would
19:58
make it this language could be used to make it much more difficult for me to do my job if I'm collaborating with people
20:04
who are outside of the United States which I frequently do furthermore the
20:10
kind of software that is used in the building of of surveillance not where or the analysis of surveillance now where
20:16
is the kind of software that gets used in all kinds of other things and so this
20:23
language is extremely problematic I don't think that the boss in our
20:28
arrangement or the export controls have to this date ever been used against
20:33
surveillance researchers but one of the things that uff is extremely wary of is
20:40
just leaving tools out there that could be used against surveillance researchers
20:45
one day saying oh surely no one will misuse this stuff it's going to be fine
20:52
so we're extremely skeptical about this sort of thing and in the meantime there
20:57
is not a lot of evidence that the vasana arrangement has actually stopped
21:02
companies from selling this kind of software to company to countries that
21:08
then turn around and and misuse it and you can see that in the UAE and you can
21:13
see it in in Mexico and more importantly you can see it from a couple of years
21:19
ago when a hacker who goes by the name of phidias Fisher dumped the mails full
21:25
of one of these sort of bad actor companies called hacking team you can actually see their discussion of this
21:32
new language and the boss in our arrangement and they just go it doesn't stop them one bit it doesn't prevent a
21:38
single sale it didn't even like constitute a bump in the road for them
21:44
so this language doesn't work and it could potentially be used for a lot of bad things which leaves us with the
21:51
question of so what do we do you know so
21:56
we're not going to solve this problem by using export controls at export trolls are only seeming to to make
22:03
potentially matters worse for people like me so how do we stop this there are
22:10
a couple of different ways one of the things that uff has done is we've caught
22:16
we've we've caught government spying on people inside of the United States we
22:22
had this case called Kidani versus Ethiopia in which it turns out that the
22:27
Ethiopian government had installed surveillance malware on on the computer
22:33
of a guy living in Silver Springs Maryland we know that they spied on his
22:38
Google searches and on his on his Skype calls and this is a violation of the
22:44
wiretapping statute I in in Maryland so we went ahead and we sued unfortunately
22:51
this was not a case that we won we actually got a really disappointing ruling where the judge refused to really
22:59
work with the substantive issue like he wouldn't even get into this whole idea that if foreign government wants to spy
23:07
on Americans in America they need to follow the law here they need to get a
23:12
warrant they need to get an M lat they have to they they have to play by the rules and what courts are really scared
23:20
of is that this will limit American ability to spy on people abroad which is
23:25
to say that other governments will say hey you need to follow the law when you want to spy on people in our country we
23:31
hear it yeah that they're tremendous fans of the rule of law and we think that would be a fine idea
23:36
I think Kidani versus Ethiopia will not be our last case in the matter I'm still
23:42
alone we've got we've got a few tricks left up ourselves one thing I'm curious about actually is how you think the law
23:49
has responded to some of these you know new questions brought by technology the
23:56
law is an inner court system they move slowly home sometimes and they're not
24:06
necessarily the most adaptable institution I think
24:12
do you think that's I mean number one do you think that's a fair assessment and number two are you seeing that play out
24:18
in litigation that EF f is has been involved in oh that's the third there
24:25
are basically two reasons why the FF does impact litigation one one of the reasons is that sometimes the law moves
24:31
lags too far behind technology and then you end up with these like really really
24:38
awful unforeseen impacts the other is that sometimes the law is made by people who don't understand the technology and
24:44
that's why we have a whole staff of technologists whose job it is to go to people on the hill and and explain the
24:51
technology to them so that they don't make bad law in the first place or so that we're able to strike down bad law
24:56
now my personal favorite is when we can stop bad law before it happens a better
25:02
feeling so yeah I think you've really you've really got two problems there and they're they're both things that uff
25:08
works on the domestic front I'm I'm
25:14
personally alarmed by the idea of government surveillance tools in the
25:20
hands of the Trump administration and so my question is you know is that is that
25:26
fear justified are we it has the
25:32
administration taking in any particular actions with regard to surveillance or privacy in the past six months that are
25:39
particularly concerning well to begin with EF F has been suing the US
25:49
government over or actually we've been suing either the ISPs or the US
25:54
government over there over the NSA's warrantless surveillance since 2006 we
26:02
didn't like it when bush was doing it we didn't like it when Obama was doing it and we don't like it when Trump is doing
26:08
it I think that regardless of who is in power you know warrantless wiretapping and
26:14
mass surveillance is not a good idea and we oppose it absolutely no matter
26:21
who is in charge I don't think that I've seen a lot of evidence that the Trump is noticeably worse than
26:28
Obama on this but Obama was pretty bad I think that there's there's a lot of
26:35
assumption that because AFF is viewed as a sort of left-leaning organization that
26:41
we automatically have just this love of the Obama administration but we we fight
26:47
for the users and we fight for civil liberties we are on the side of civil liberties and if you are on the wrong
26:52
side we will come for you and so we spent a lot of time criticizing the Obama administration for their lack of
26:58
transparency all while billing themselves the most transparent administration ever and we
27:06
have exactly the same criticisms of the Trump administration right and things
27:11
like you know the surveillance act looks seven of two that's not gone away and
27:20
it's not a you know it's possibly well 702 702 until sunset right into some
27:26
every time to come yes so every time 702 comes up for sunset we we show up on the
27:32
hill we we try to get our vase to come out and explain that it's extremely
27:38
important that we sunset 702 and having this sort of surveillance state forever forever a Amen is not a good idea and
27:46
does not benefit civil liberties no in fact it doesn't even make us safer yeah
27:52
I mean I agree with you on that one um what what would you some people would say in response to this well you know if
27:59
people if you're not doing something wrong if you're not committing a crime then you don't have anything to worry
28:05
about what would your response be to that well there are a lot of different
28:12
responses to this there are a lot of ways that you can take it but I think the most important thing to keep in mind
28:17
is that in the end everybody has something to hide there is a reason why
28:23
we lock our doors while why we close our curtains privacy is one of the most
28:28
fundamental basic rights that you have as an American and it is also a
28:33
fundamental human right the government does not have the right to come into your home
28:39
without a warrant and look through your stuff and we think that this also applies to the digital realm especially
28:45
when the the information available about you when somebody searches the digital
28:51
realm is so detailed and so incredibly personal and so that really speaks to
28:56
the to the core of our mission furthermore even if you feel like you don't have anything to hide maybe you
29:03
know you all your doors are unlocked and maybe you don't wear pants and maybe
29:09
you're just like living life all out there in the open not everyone is in a
29:14
position to do that the the world is is full of people who who have things to
29:20
hide who are not up to no good i if you are for example a a woman on the
29:29
internet with opinions let me tell you you have things to hide because people will come after you and harass you the
29:36
same thing is true of of Muslims and people of color it's true of people with
29:41
unpopular political opinions it's people it's true of people with unpopular religious beliefs and so even if you
29:47
feel like you don't have something to hide it's really important to protect this right for these other people I mean
29:53
for one thing somewhere down the line you could become one of them right then
29:59
you would regret that potential stance that you had in the past once it begins detecting you that's one day they're
30:06
gonna come for you so what are some things that people can do to secure their own privacy online well
30:14
specifically the FF has a website that we have devoted entirely to security and
30:20
privacy advice and it's called surveillance self-defense you can get there at SSD e FF dot org probably the
30:28
the most common things that I suggest to people are update your software please
30:33
PLEASE Lea's update your software use a password manager so that you have long
30:39
strong and unique passwords for all of you are for all of your accounts turn on
30:46
to FA for accounts where two FA is available to FA through an
30:52
location like of--they or google authenticator is better than 2f a through SMS which is not always the best
30:59
thing but for many people to FA through SMS is better than nothing
31:06
when websites have you enter a separate code in addition to your password in
31:12
order to lock them when you enter when you enter a website by just giving your
31:18
username and login what you're giving them is a one factor of authentication and so 2fa stands for two-factor
31:26
authentication and that second factor is a special one-time code that you are sent in order to log into your website
31:33
and what this means is that if somebody steals or copies or somehow intercepts
31:39
your password and they try to log in with it without that second code they're still not getting it and that is
31:46
fantastic protection that I think everybody should have yeah in other particular behaviors that people should
31:53
be aware of when they're online or you know things they should do or not do when they're browsing you know Facebook
32:00
or wherever well I think everybody really has a different appetite for risk
32:06
some people look at a roller coaster and they go there's no way I'm getting on that and some people look at a roller
32:12
coaster and they go this is a great time I would like to spend all day riding roller coasters and the Internet is
32:18
really much the same one of the things that I really would recommend is taking
32:24
a look at your sort of social media profiles and seeing what can be gleaned
32:31
about you by a stranger so log out of Facebook and take a look at your Facebook profile and see whether
32:38
or not you're giving away any information about yourself that you would really rather people did not know
32:43
and the same thing is true for you know snapchat and Instagram and Twitter just
32:49
get an idea of what what a stranger can see about you and put together and
