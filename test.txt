0:00 Hi Eva. Hey there, and welcome to Bloggingheads. Thank you so much for having me.
0:06 Yes, thank you very much for being here. Let me introduce ourselves. I am Philip Menchaca, editor at Bloggingheads TV, and you are Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. That's right. And we are going to talk today about privacy and security generally, and specifically talk a little bit about net neutrality and maybe some state-sponsored malware issues. But first, can you just tell me what the EFF does?
0:40 Sure. EFF stands for Electronic Frontier Foundation. We are a digital civil liberties organization that has been around since 1990, and our job is to make sure that when you go online, your rights come with you. 
0:55 So what are some of the current projects that EFF is engaged in?
1:03 Well, the EFF is currently a vast undertaking, so there are a lot of us working on different things. But one of the most interesting things about our approach is that we have this sort of unique combination of tools and skills that we can bring to the table, sort of like the Justice League. So sometimes the problems that face the internet require a lawyer, and then we file lawsuits. We do what's called impact litigation, so we file a lawsuit with the intention of getting a ruling that will impact people further down the line. This is a lot of the kind of thing that the ACLU does for civil liberties, both online andPeople further down the line, this is a lot of the kind of thing that the ACLU does for civil liberties both online and offline. We also have activists for when you need to get people out onto the streets, when you need people to sign petitions, when you need people to write letters or call their senators or congressmen. And we also have a bunch of engineers, and what our engineers do is sometimes they build tools like the Chrome extensions that we run like HTTPS Everywhere and Privacy Badger. We're also part of the group that works on Certbot, she's also known as Let's Encrypt, making it really easy for people to get free SSL certificates for their websites. And we also do research into the kinds of problems that people, and especially vulnerable populations have, so we have a website called Surveillance Self-Defense, which is our privacy and security guide, and we go around doing trainings. We also do reports on dangers to privacy and security online to vulnerable populations, including state-sponsored malware, which is a fairly large part of my work, and we do policy work around this sort of thing as well. So sometimes you have to go to the hill where you have to go to like the European Court of Human Rights and talk to them about why the Internet is important and why the kind of rights that you have offline should also be the kind of rights that you have online.Great, so you have a whole bunch of tools at your disposal at the EFF involved in a lot of different things. Actually, use some of the extensions such as Privacy Badgering and HTTPS Everywhere, which encrypts your access to certain websites when you browse online. So, I recommend people go and check out some of these resources and information that the EFF has. That's what the EFF does. To kick off our conversation here, I want to talk with you about an issue that's been in the news recently. Again, it's sort of a slow-burning, actually, I think years-long issue now at this point, and that is net neutrality. And this is just to kind of set what the controversy is right now. The FCC is looking at repealing some...Obamacare..not Obamacare, some rules while it's also Obamacare, Obamacare, looking at repealing some rules that were put in place under Obama that protected net neutrality. But just to start off basic, can you define what people mean when they say net neutrality? 

Alright, so net neutrality is not a law like the law of gravity. It's sort of a principle that certain... (transcript ends abruptly)Lot like the law of gravity it's sort of a principle that certain companies and ISPs have abided by for many years. And the idea is that a packet is a packet is a packet, and what an ISP does is it moves packets and it treats all of those packets the same. And if you are going to one website, you should not be able to get better bandwidth than if you are going to some other website. And the reason why net neutrality is so important is because if you have this sort of pay-for-play system where people can pay for better treatment by ISPs or preferential treatment by ISPs for their bandwidth, then the companies with a lot of money and with pre-existing relationships with the ISPs or that are owned by the ISPs are at an unfair advantage. And new companies that have new ideas and new services that are up-and-coming or startups are at a disadvantage. So this would have a tremendously chilling effect on startups and anybody who doesn't necessarily have a lot of money from the very beginning. So these rules were put in place under Obama to kind of keep an even playing field, is that correct? Mm-hmm. Yes, so particular companies couldn't pay.6:19 "Say Verizon to boost their speed or...or"
6:24 "Not throttle the speed of their website"
6:30 "So I guess the worry here is that for instance a company like Verizon, or Comcast who is an Internet service provider and provides Internet to people... (music plays in the background)"
6:47 "Could selectively choose which websites run well on your browser. Was that accurate? Yes, absolutely."
