my sister hi Philip how are you I'm
0:10
great how are you I am doing well thanks for joining me on meaning of life sure
0:16
happy to be here yeah let me introduce us I am Philip menchaca and this is meaning of life TV available
0:23
as an audio and video podcast and you are sister Teresa of may Thea noble a
0:32
professed religious sister with the daughters of st. Paul and the author of
0:37
the book the prodigal he loved inviting loved ones back to the church and I
0:43
wanted to talk to you today about faith and atheism and I think we'll probably get into the problem of suffering or the
0:50
problem of evil as it's sometimes called and I'm particularly interested in your
0:55
perspective because like you I leave I I was raised Catholic and like you at one
1:03
point I became an atheist and in fact I still AM but you clearly have returned
1:11
to the church so to start I just want to
1:17
talk about your religious upbringing and what that was like was your family
1:22
highly observant they were we were very very Catholic my dad what has a PhD in
1:29
theology and so he worked for a Catholic University for a while and then he
1:35
worked for diocese and in then he taught at secular colleges and community
1:41
colleges and my mother stayed home for a lot of my childhood and she really
1:47
brought brought the Liturgy of the church into the house we just you know whatever was happening in church was
1:53
happening in her house we knew when Advent was we knew when Lent was and we knew when the saint's feast days were
2:00
and and so yeah they were we were they
2:06
were very very faithful and for you always on board without are you were you
2:13
very faithful as kid um you know I my mom tells this
2:18
story and I don't remember it but she said she said that she says when I was younger I was watchin this TV show about
2:26
the Gospel story and it was at the point of the crucifixion and I was probably
2:31
you know I I'm guessing it was probably like four or five and I Jesus is being
2:39
crucified and the characters are crying and she said I went up to the TV and I hugged the TV and I said don't cry it's
2:48
because Jesus is dying for us he's he's saving us so this is a good thing so I I
2:55
did have a strong faith um my dad he did an evangelism course so he would
3:01
actually this was a very unusual for Catholics at the time but he would
3:06
actually go door to door knocking on people's doors and talking to them about Jesus so I would always want to go with
3:12
him I was really excited about that but at the same time I you know I I
3:17
wasn't in my faith and I had a relationship with God that I would say was pretty strong but I also was a very
3:25
skeptical child from from the very beginning like I I remember the first
3:31
time I had doubts that God existed and I was five at the time and I who met like
3:38
the moment is kind of in blazoned in my mind I was just walking up the stairs and all of a sudden the thought occurred
3:45
to me what if God doesn't exist and so
3:50
you know to have that thought at five years old I really couldn't cope with the implications of it at the time it
3:56
just kind of crumbled my rule for a second and then I just like put it back together I was like I'm just not gonna think about that just keep going ya
4:05
can't handle that right now but I was that kind of kid you know I was always asking questions my dad was a theologian
4:12
so he was very educated and able to answer a lot of my questions but I often was not satisfied with them um a big one
4:21
that I always had was when Moses comes to you know first of all he's in the
4:27
does with these whining whining people for 40 years he gets to the end of this long
4:32
journey and he God tells him to hit this rock because the people don't have water
4:38
and he tells him to hit it I think three times and he hits it one too many times
4:43
because he's really getting annoyed with these whining people I can you understand like 40 years and so God says
4:50
you hit it too many times you're not going into the Promised Land and I remember fighting with my dad about that
4:56
just if God is like that I don't believe in him like I would just it was so
5:03
upsetting to me that that story so and that was you know that was me all the
5:08
time I was always arguing about everything and pushing back on everything so that so it kind of it
5:15
would there was always a tension for me yeah I mean I've certainly had similar
5:22
feelings about stories in the Bible where there are stories I mean job of
5:28
course is one of the classic ones and why would God inflict such suffering on him and did you have you ever resolved
5:38
that in your mind some of these these questions um yeah you know there are
5:47
still things that I that I struggle with um even after I came back to the church
5:53
I think one of them I started going to Mass pretty regularly after I came back
5:58
to the church and um one of the first stories is and I'm forgetting her name
6:03
but she her father promises God if I win this battle I'll sacrifice to you the
6:09
first person I see when I come back and from the battle and he wins the battle and his daughter comes out of the house
6:16
and he sacrifices her and so this is that this is that daily Mass and the
6:23
priest well it was the first reading so that was red and then the gospel and the
6:29
priest didn't say a word about it and afterwards he came out and there is
6:35
hilarious because I waited for him you know like like you're waiting for a rock started to like
6:40
exit the concert and he comes out and I'm like father how could you talk about
6:46
that why like how how could that be okay
6:52
and he gave me a really unsatisfactory answer and I remember walking away from
6:58
that interaction feeling like so frustrated it was like my childhood all over again but it but it is different
7:06
and I think it's only different through my my more mature relationship with God
7:12
not that I understand everything but it's not as much of a struggle for me as
7:19
it was around the child yeah so I mean
7:26
can you given it example I mean it might be kind of difficult to put into words
7:31
but what do you mean by a more mature relationship with God I mean how does
7:38
that manifest well I mean you are a sister so one way it manifests mm-hmm
7:49
it's just it's just a phrase that's always sort of puzzled me because I have never felt you know I would go to church
7:57
when I was a kid oh my we weren't a
8:02
especially religious family but and go every Sunday for until probably Iowa
8:09
probably I was 12 or 13 when we started going less and less but I've never I've
8:17
never felt that sort of relationship with God so I hear people of faith often talk about having a relationship with
8:22
God and to me I just don't quite understand what that means hmm yeah yeah um I guess the the best
8:36
way to describe it is you know when I was an atheist I struggled with I
8:43
[Music] struggled with spirituality and what I believed in and um
8:50
I started you know I wanted to be an educated atheist so I started to study
8:56
other religions you know I figured I knew enough about Christianity I was a little arrogant so I started to study
9:02
Buddhism and other different things and um but I so I was I kind of started to
9:12
make an intellectual journey towards believing in God while I was an atheist
9:18
and there were different steps in that journey that that moves me but I also
9:25
had a conversion experience you know as that journey went along it kind of culminated in the conversion experience
9:32
and that conversion experience was not an intellectual movement towards
9:39
believing in the existence of God because I kind of made steps as far as I could but the conversion experience was
9:47
in meeting a person and knowing that that this would that because I kind of
9:55
entertained this idea that there's this universal kind of force in the world or
10:01
kind of kind of this quasi spirituality but it wasn't really I would didn't
10:07
believe in a personal God but in this conversion experience it it wasn't my
10:13
intellect kind of achieving something it was being introduced to a person and so
10:19
you know just like Paul on the road to Damascus falls falls down he meets Jesus
10:24
Christ and bam his life is different it was the same for me like I I knew a
10:29
person and and so I started to relate to that person and dialogue with that
10:34
person and pray you know throughout the day you just have having conversations
10:41
it's like a friend you know and that
10:47
relationship with some with but it's not a friend it's not like a another human
10:53
being it is being itself and you know it's it's kind of amazing that being
11:01
itself would to me and kind of be in relationship with me but it's kind of a sublime thing
11:09
but but it kind of puts everything in perspective because the things that I
11:15
don't understand I can I can understand it and in terms of my trust in this in this being
11:24
there's that relationship of trust that makes it impossible to have faith
11:31
despite doubts okay yeah yeah I think
11:36
Kierkegaard describes it in fear and trembling Abraham certainly had doubts and
11:44
certainly did not understand what God was commanding and to do but the fact
11:50
that he trusted in a person was what allowed him to to do what he did to move
11:56
forward because he trusted in the power of this person more than in his confusion and his doubts so let's talk a
12:06
little bit about your journey and how old were you when you well how old were
12:12
you when you realize that you were an atheist and how old were you when you announced your an atheist which may or
12:18
may not be the same age but I'm just curious um so I was 14 and I remember
12:26
the moment I was it was actually related to the problem of suffering I was kind
12:31
of mulling it over that in my mind I was driving I wasn't driving I was 14 but my
12:36
parents are driving and I was in the back of the car and I was just thinking my family was facing a lot of suffering
12:42
at the time and I remember thinking I just I can't I couldn't understand a God
12:50
who would allow my family to suffer like this especially when my family was trying so hard to serve Him and so it
12:58
was really the the problem of suffering but also because my my father worked so
13:05
closely with the church I kind of saw the underbelly of it and I saw people
13:10
behaving hypocritically people being very unsure edible people being much I
13:16
mean worse than uncharitable just you know really nasty things and I remember
13:22
thinking to myself it's very important to me to be a good and virtuous person
13:27
these people have basically devoted their lives to the church and they are
13:32
not that and so I think I can do this on my own I think I can do a better job on
13:39
my own basically so those were kind of some of the things that were going on
13:45
that kind of pushed me into atheism and I'm I'm the kind of person that I don't
13:50
I don't hide what's going on in my head so my parents knew right away I said I'm
13:57
me and also at the time I was supposed to be confirmed and so my parents said
14:03
we're pushing and pushing me and I said I don't believe in God how can I be
14:08
confirmed if I don't believe in God so yeah so it was pretty much bam bam how
14:16
did they react um they were I mean they were devastated
14:22
that pirate but I I think they also realized that that it wasn't something
14:29
that they could control and I also I also said to them also go to Mass I'll
14:34
still you know do whatever you want me to do because I'm under your roof but I just want to be clear with you like I
14:40
don't believe in God and I'm not gonna be confirmed and so yeah they struggled
14:49
with it but there but I think they also maybe thought that it was going to be a
14:56
little bit less of a thing but it ended up being so I think they were hoping oh
15:02
this will be over pretty soon and then it wasn't over and then I think they started to get concerned
15:08
how long did your atheism persist um I
15:14
was away from the church for about 12 years and I was in a an atheist for most of that time yeah so at some point did
15:25
you start being a seeker as they are called someone who is searching out for
15:32
different kinds of spiritualities exploring yeah and I can't really you
15:39
know I can't really say exactly when that started and and it's hard to say
15:44
when you're you know cuz for most of the time I still didn't believe in God I had
15:50
a thought that maybe there was something beyond the material but but I didn't
15:57
believe in God until my conversion experience so it's hard to say when people ask how long exactly was your
16:02
name pious I don't know you know it's kind of a strange question in a way because that's not really how beliefs or
16:09
intellectual thinking works usually there's not usually one moment conversion experiences might you know
16:14
that's that's an exception so yeah I did
16:20
in college I in college I I basically was interested in being an informed a
16:27
yes I wouldn't have called myself a seeker but I but I did go see a Buddhist
16:32
monk speak once and I remember being intrigued by by his idea that desire is
16:38
the source of suffering and I remember being intrigued by his way of life and
16:43
so different things kind of intrigued me but it wasn't enough for me to say that
16:50
I was even a seeker for spiritual when I
16:55
left college I was teaching in the inner city in Miami and I was in Teach for
17:01
America ah I was do oh yeah where were
17:08
you I was in New York okay yeah so as you know to show America is very hard it
17:15
is a unique experience barely but um
17:23
yeah so and it was our it was the first year that TFA was in Miami so that's
17:29
like another difficulty on top of difficulty and so I was struggling a lot
17:35
so I remember it and at the teacher I was in a situation where I had to be
17:41
had to be a better person that I was like my kids I taught third grade and my kids came
17:49
from all kinds of different backgrounds that made them kind of need more than a
17:55
teacher from me they needed a lot more attention and patience and love and I
18:01
just didn't didn't have it you know I just lost my patience all the time I I
18:09
remember thinking I need to be a better person and I want to be a good person I wanted me who these kids need me to be but I
18:16
don't have it in me like theirs I need I need to do some work on me and so I
18:23
started to meditate and I started going to quicker meetings every every week my
18:32
college had been quicker so I kind of gotten introduced to that through that through my college I still didn't
18:39
believe in God and honestly quite a few of the people at the meeting probably didn't either but it was kind of a time where I could
18:46
just be in silence and it was non-dogmatic and nobody was trying to convert me it but it was just a quiet
18:53
time and so I I I would say that I started to kind of move towards the
19:00
seeker during that time because I started to realize at on my whole quest
19:05
to be a good person I just don't have the resources within me to do it to face
19:10
these challenges without some kind of guidance so I think that's what led me
19:17
to start seeking yeah so what but when was your conversion experience was it
19:23
after you had finished Teach for America so teacher America's two years and then yeah so then I moved to California my
19:31
boyfriend at the time was going to school there and getting his ph.d and so I I was taking time off too before I
19:38
went to law school and so I applied to law schools and I started to travel I
19:44
went to Costa Rica and I was in this little little rural town in Costa Rica
19:50
where the roads get flooded and in the fall and you're just like totally stranded and but um there is a it was
20:00
called an environmental learning cooperative that was started by two Peace Corps volunteers in the middle of
20:06
the town and so I volunteered with them like I worked in the kitchen and I would
20:11
carry firewood I work in the garden and I lives at the local family and I
20:17
remember being in this in this town and realizing that everyone there except for
20:23
all the Westerners that were kind of in this little Enclave well you didn't got like they were very faithful people and
20:30
I remember thinking to myself why they believe in God you know that I'd been
20:38
kind of out of that milieu for so long that it was kind of shocking to me and
20:43
so I started to go through all the answers like well they're poor and you
20:49
know it's dandy among people they need that they need that hope were um they're
20:55
uneducated most of them who hadn't even gotten to high school so you know if they had that the chance of education
21:01
that I did then they probably wouldn't believe in God and as I went through
21:07
these answers in my head I was thinking wow I sound like such a jerk I was
21:13
thinking you know and also I'm not giving these people the the credit that
21:19
they deserve because as I got to know them and interact with them I I found
21:26
that they were so grounded that they had like such a rootedness in them and in
21:32
their lives and they and the way that they interacted with me just was really fascinating to me and and in you know in
21:40
my whole quest to be a good person I was looking at them and thinking they're good people I like how did they become good people
21:47
and so it was like these uneducated poor people knew more about life than I did
21:55
they knew something that I didn't know and so I I remember one day I was
22:00
gardening and I was waiting and this guy came up to me he was
22:05
he was the town drunk and he said he said Haiti Teresita he's like isn't it a
22:11
beautiful day like thank God for this beautiful day and I looked up at him and I'm I'm very like straightforward I was
22:19
like a fool I it's a beautiful day but I I don't have anybody to thank for it
22:24
because I don't believe in God oh wow and I remember he looked at me like like
22:33
kind of astounded um I think mostly because you just you know
22:40
he just probably never heard that before from anybody like you knew the other Westerners and they probably thought the
22:46
same thing that they probably never told it to his date but he didn't look upset
22:53
at me at all he just looked um kind of slightly amused and and as I looked into
23:00
his eyes I felt like I was looking at like some kind of primordial being I was
23:06
just like there was this wisdom in the town drunks I is that I didn't have I
23:11
was like how does he how does he have this wisdom and how does he know something that I don't know and he he
23:18
didn't really say anything to me he just said okay you know and that was the end of the conversation but there was
23:24
something in his eyes that kind of moved me so the people moved me and I think
23:30
that kind of prepared my heart for my conversion and my conversion happened I
23:36
was walking to the farm one day and it was really early in the morning and it's Costa Rica so it's gorgeous and
23:43
beautiful and the mountains were around me and I was and you know it was kind of
23:49
like what chapo had said to me it's a beautiful day aren't you thankful and I I felt this feeling of gratitude in my
23:56
heart for the beauty and at the same time there was a huge gust of wind and I
24:04
felt like one of the trees is gonna fall on me and kind of felt afraid and so I felt this mixture of fear and gratitude
24:11
at the same time and in that moment God introduced himself to me and I knew
24:19
that God existed and that God wasn't just some impersonal force but it was a
24:24
personal God and that he loved me and that he had a plan for my life and and
24:32
so after that it was I'm kind of a person of extremes so I was on the plane
24:39
ride home and I was like all right I know God exists and he had the plan for
24:44
my life and I got into law school and that's my plan that's not God's plan and I'm not gonna go to law school and have
24:51
a boyfriend it was probably gonna marry invent it with him for five years but that's my plan that's not God but but
25:06
that's what happens when you like it's it's not just an intellectual movement
25:11
it's a meeting a person meeting like a personality like a personal God who I I
25:20
was in a relationship with who I couldn't like I couldn't turn my back on
25:26
it yeah like I can turn my back on an idea that
25:31
can turn my background and personal God so when did you decide to become a
25:41
religious sister so I didn't immediately
25:47
go back to the church I was you know I in fact I was really uninterested in
25:53
becoming Catholic Hey but I kind of slowly made my way back to
25:59
the church and that was only through my relationship with God you know I I I'm chat with him every day and I just I I
26:07
felt like you that's where he was moving me um different I would meet different people and they would like talk to me
26:14
about the Lobos search effort there was just different things that kind of moved me in that direction um why were you why were you not
26:23
interested in going back to the Catholic Church
26:28
I kind of felt like I've been there done that I also wasn't um I wasn't totally
26:35
sold on Jesus you know I believed in God but I I wasn't totally sure I was
26:41
Christian you know at that point it was just I know God exists and that's it
26:47
that's all I really know right now so so it was hard to kind of figure out what
26:54
how where I was gonna go but now it wasn't like it wasn't like it just an intellectual journey it was a journey
27:01
with God so so I probably ended up coming to the Catholics are so much
27:06
faster than I would have if I hadn't thought about it a lot because even
27:12
after joining I you know I still had many things I disagreed with um I
27:18
intellectually it didn't make sense to me now it does a lot more but at first I
27:24
it was it was very confusing to me not that God would lead me back to the
27:29
Catholic Church but I think a big part of it was also the Eucharist I had a
27:35
sense of God's presence in the Eucharist and I think that that that helped me to
27:41
believe that God was present in the church yeah so what is the process for
27:47
becoming well I was gonna say none but I
27:53
guess technically nuns are closed right yeah but what does that process look
27:59
like um basically you go through a time
28:04
of discernment and so I after I came back to the church I felt God calling me
28:10
to think about religious life and again I was like a wave like you can forget
28:16
about it see about doing that my first response
28:23
and probably my response for several years but I but once you once you
28:30
discern you look at it you can go visit different orders and there's thousands it's really kind of overwhelming there
28:37
are a lot of religious orders around the country I was in the Bayer yeah at the time so I
28:42
did a few orders in that area and I ended up finding about about the
28:49
daughters of st. Paul online which is appropriate because they they try to spread the word of God through modern
28:55
media so so I was watching a YouTube video and someone mentioned so I ended
29:02
up visiting them and so really it's you feel a call and then and then you have
29:07
to kind of discern and midst that call which order do I feel calm - what kind
29:12
of we call it a charism of the Holy Spirit like which charism do I feel
29:18
called to what kind of work in the church do I feel called to and then and
29:23
then you apply and they you know they're
29:29
checking you out just as much as you're checking him out just to make sure that it's a good fit that it's that you're
29:35
doing it for the right reasons it has it's very important that there's a lot of freedom in this decision because it's
29:42
not something that you want to feel like like your mom kind of pushed you in or
29:48
you know whatever or even even um a lack of freedom within yourself the only like
29:54
God's calling you but you can't say no and that kind of thing so yeah and once
30:00
you're in it's two years of well for our order it varies but two years of novitiate two years of postulants II
30:07
five years of temporary vows which I'm in temporary vows which that means that
30:12
I take I take my vows a year at a time so I take a vow of chastity poverty and
30:18
obedience for this year and then I do it for the next year and then after five
30:23
years I I do it for the rest of my life
30:29
so going back to the I guess the problem of suffering how do you deal with that
30:38
now do you still struggle with with that
30:43
yeah um every year we have a one-week silent retreat and
30:50
during that retreat you basically it's silent the entire time except for a meeting with your director and a mass
30:57
and prayer and I would I can say every single year I struggle the problem with
31:04
Stanford it's a problem it's a it is you know it's kind of the way my retreat
31:12
begins every year I'm like wrestling with it with God and you know one year a
31:20
family friends three-year-old drowned in their pool and that's how I began my
31:26
retreat was just like God why how could that how could you allow that to happen
31:32
you're all-powerful so definitely I still struggle with it I guess the
31:38
difference is that not that I have all the answers I don't think there's
31:46
there's any intellectual answer that's that's completely satisfying but um but
31:54
I wrestle with it with God I think one thing that I've come to is that God sees
32:00
things differently than we do and one of the major things he sees differently is death which is something that I've been
32:08
meditating on a lot I do lately especially and so meditating on death
32:14
and the Christian view of death has helped me to see the problem of suffering or liver differently yeah
32:20
that's something that I want to talk to you about because I know that you're a proponent of memento mori anyone who
32:27
follows you on twitter will know this so I guess first we should just explain
32:34
mobile meant amore is yeah so it's an ancient tradition in the
32:39
church I mean it had its heyday in medieval times memento mori is the latin phrase that means remember that you'll die remember
32:46
your death but it really it has its roots in in Scripture and in the church
32:52
and in the early church you know in Syriac chapter 7 verse 38 it says and
32:59
whatever you do remember your last days and you person there are several songs that
33:05
mentioned thinking about your about eternity and so it's really practice
33:10
that's rooted in Scripture st. Benedict his 47th rule is to tap daily or your
33:17
death before you so it's really something that but also stoic
33:22
philosophers yeah a lot of stoic certain momentum or it's very interesting there's kind of a secular group of
33:28
people who are into momentum Orion yeah we have someone who contributes to the
33:34
site Massimo Pigliucci who's that our Pigliucci I think it's who it's one
33:41
of the leaders in the stoic movement and so yeah yeah so it's I mean it's an idea
33:50
that that anyone can really practice to to meditate on your death and to think
33:56
about it to kind of put your life in the perspective of your deaths every single day and so the way that I've done that
34:02
is I can show you the skull made us it's kind of well little too much skull is to
34:09
have a skull on my desk and so every day look at that skull and I I just think okay my day and the perspective of my
34:16
death and I have no idea when that's gonna be because very often we like to think very idealistically about her death like oh
34:23
I'm gonna die the old age I'm gonna be a hundred but we never know when we're gonna die it could be tomorrow it could
34:30
be in a couple of minutes we have no idea when we're gonna die so putting life in that perspective just changes
34:37
everything I mean it can they're they're few responses to that you know putting
34:42
it into that perspective if you could you could say oh you only live once so let's just do whatever there's that that
34:50
the key to this response yeah exactly but the Christian response and and I
34:56
think you know I think the stoic response to would be the to I want to live my life in the best way possible
35:03
because I don't know when my death can do will be and so instead of kind of wasting my my day or
35:10
and my time thinking about my life as far as third my death as far in the future I'm gonna I'm gonna live well try
35:18
to live well every minute and that is like that's a real discipline I mean ever since I started this practice I
35:25
it's really become apparent to me how much time I waste and just how many how
35:31
many things I do that if I really was gonna die tomorrow I'm not so sure I'd be doing right yeah
35:38
yeah that's I mean it has a long history meditating and death has I think a long
35:44
long history in various religions I know in Buddhism for instance there's there
35:51
are certain medications where you meditate on death than the body and goodbye rotting body rotting yeah so
35:59
you've actually done Buddhist meditation is that right you said you were interested in Buddhism I was and I did I
36:06
did meditation that I don't know you know I didn't my Western kind of curious
36:13
Western girl interested in Buddhism kind of form of meditation and that form of
36:18
meditation I found very difficult and I don't know if I was doing it wrong like
36:24
everyone feels like they're doing it wrong that's what everyone kept telling me is what everyone feels like they're
36:31
doing it wrong but I was I think I was really really pretty pretty bad at it I mean I would always fall asleep I kind
36:38
of be kind of be sitting next to my bed as early in the morning and I'd find
36:43
myself like on the floor like and and I
36:52
would I you know the whole idea of not kind of letting your thoughts will float
36:57
by I just couldn't do that I it was a huge struggle for me so prayer push the
37:04
Christian form of prayer and we do have what is called meditation where but for
37:10
us meditation is like meditating on the gospel is actually kind of chewing on it you're you're actually like thinking
37:17
about it an intellectual experience well yeah the
37:23
like in the process of Alexia reading scripture like the first part is kind of
37:28
intellectual and the meta Tatsu is yeah it's kind of chewing on it but it's also entering into it and you're you're kind
37:34
of praying with it but you can enter the scene and so it can be kind of imaginative too but but then then the
37:43
part where your thoughts where I guess it would be a little bit more similar its contemplation where but you're not
37:50
trying to control it you just allow whatever is happening to happen so I think that's what makes it easier for me
37:58
because I I feel like I'm in a dialogue with someone I'm not just kind of by
38:03
myself and so I'm dialoguing and then and then
38:08
it goes to silence and and that silence just is natural it's almost like you
38:15
know when you're with someone you love and you do you just stop talking and and it's silent for a little while and and
38:23
that's just it's just perfect it's just like more beautiful than when you were
38:28
talking but you're still kind of communicating so um I think for me that
38:33
silence is different because I'm still communicating with some someone so do
38:40
you think that having gone through a loss of faith and then returned to the church makes it easier for you to
38:49
communicate with people who are atheist or agnostic or struggling with faith I
38:54
hope so and that was a subject of your
39:01
book correct yeah yeah um so I wrote a book called the prodigal you loved
39:07
inviting loved ones back to the church and the reason I wrote it was because our sisters run bookstores and so when I
39:16
entered the convent I was working in these bookstores and any priest or nun will tell you that a big prayer requests
39:23
that we receive is pray for my son or daughter who is away from this church which is natural because a lot of people
39:30
are leaving the church so um oftentimes I would kind of share my story with people
39:37
or I try to give them a little bit of advice if I felt like they needed it and
39:42
in some cases you know one lady told me I tell him I say he's gonna go to hell
39:48
every single day and I was looking at
39:53
her to see if there is any sort of like self-awareness and I remember thinking
40:03
you know there might be some people out there who are really struggling with this and struggling with how to like
40:09
some people of faith just don't understand what it's like to doubt they don't understand what it's like to be to
40:15
feel skeptical and I and you have to understand that the thing is I'm the
40:22
woman I entered the convent in with she said one time to me you know you know I
40:27
I don't think I've ever doubted that God existed and I looked at her and I said you haven't thought about it or not like
40:34
I'm a people of faith who say that they don't have doubts I just haven't thought
40:40
about it enough and simple you know one of the things I talk about in my book is you if you're a person of
40:48
faith and you're trying to invite people back to the church you have to get in touch with your doubts you have to wrestle with them you have to understand
40:55
what the other person is going through so that you can relate to them in a way that doesn't come across as patronizing
41:01
and arrogant yeah yeah well we should
41:07
probably wrap up but this has really been a delightful conversation and I just have one last question just that
41:12
satisfying my curiosity your name labia
41:17
is that that's Greek for truth is that right mm-hmm yeah so that's my religious name so when
41:25
we take our vows for the first time the chooser religious me and I had been
41:30
thinking about Veritas the Latin word for truth but I wanted truth because
41:36
that well first of all the daughters of st. Paul have a devotion to Jesus way
41:42
truth in life but for me I felt like I
41:48
had been seeking truth my whole life like I was thirsty for it my whole life all I've always been fighting to
41:54
understand and to grasp the truth and and what I've realized is that the truth
42:01
is is a person and so and and and while I was pursuing that truth factories is
42:08
pursuing me so that's why I chose that name not I also I suppose explains your
42:14
Twitter handle huh yep yeah it's pursued by truth right exactly and is there any
42:24
other place that people can find information about the daughters of st. Paul or any anything that you write yeah
42:32
our website is Pauline dot work and I write for a Latina org which is
42:38
appropriate but it smells a little bit differently as a le Atia and la le ITI a
42:47
no 8l e te IA there we go yeah okay
42:54
great well thank you very much for taking the time to talk with me I greatly enjoyed our conversation yeah
43:01
